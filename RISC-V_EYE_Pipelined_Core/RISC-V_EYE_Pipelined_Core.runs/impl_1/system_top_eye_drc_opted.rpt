2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 memory_inst/ram_reg has an input control pin memory_inst/ram_reg/WEA[0] (net: memory_inst/data_memory_write_enable_out) which is driven by a register (core_inst/ex_mem_register_inst/mem_write_enable_out_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1839#2 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 memory_inst/ram_reg has an input control pin memory_inst/ram_reg/WEA[1] (net: memory_inst/data_memory_write_enable_out) which is driven by a register (core_inst/ex_mem_register_inst/mem_write_enable_out_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1839#3 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 memory_inst/ram_reg has an input control pin memory_inst/ram_reg/WEA[2] (net: memory_inst/data_memory_write_enable_out) which is driven by a register (core_inst/ex_mem_register_inst/mem_write_enable_out_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset.

REQP-1839#4 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 memory_inst/ram_reg has an input control pin memory_inst/ram_reg/WEA[3] (net: memory_inst/data_memory_write_enable_out) which is driven by a register (core_inst/ex_mem_register_inst/mem_write_enable_out_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
