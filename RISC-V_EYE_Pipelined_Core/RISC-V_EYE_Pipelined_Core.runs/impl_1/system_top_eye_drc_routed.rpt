2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net core_inst/control_unit_inst/alu_op_select_out_reg[3]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin core_inst/control_unit_inst/alu_op_select_out_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell core_inst/control_unit_inst/alu_op_select_out_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net core_inst/control_unit_inst/alu_src_a_select_out_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin core_inst/control_unit_inst/alu_src_a_select_out_reg_i_2/O, cell core_inst/control_unit_inst/alu_src_a_select_out_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net core_inst/control_unit_inst/imm_extend_op_select_out_reg[1]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin core_inst/control_unit_inst/imm_extend_op_select_out_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell core_inst/control_unit_inst/imm_extend_op_select_out_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net core_inst/control_unit_inst/reg_write_enable_out_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin core_inst/control_unit_inst/reg_write_enable_out_reg_i_2/O, cell core_inst/control_unit_inst/reg_write_enable_out_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net core_inst/control_unit_inst/result_source_select_out_reg[1]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin core_inst/control_unit_inst/result_source_select_out_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell core_inst/control_unit_inst/result_source_select_out_reg[1]_i_2.

This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 memory_inst/ram_reg has an input control pin memory_inst/ram_reg/WEA[0] (net: memory_inst/data_memory_write_enable_out) which is driven by a register (core_inst/ex_mem_register_inst/mem_write_enable_out_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
