2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell core_inst/hazard_unit_inst/stall_fetch_out_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) core_inst/hazard_unit_inst/stall_fetch_out_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance memory_inst/ram_reg, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch core_inst/control_unit_inst/alu_op_select_out_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin core_inst/control_unit_inst/alu_op_select_out_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch core_inst/control_unit_inst/alu_op_select_out_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin core_inst/control_unit_inst/alu_op_select_out_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch core_inst/control_unit_inst/alu_op_select_out_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin core_inst/control_unit_inst/alu_op_select_out_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch core_inst/control_unit_inst/alu_op_select_out_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin core_inst/control_unit_inst/alu_op_select_out_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch core_inst/control_unit_inst/alu_src_a_select_out_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin core_inst/control_unit_inst/alu_src_a_select_out_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch core_inst/control_unit_inst/alu_src_b_select_out_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin core_inst/control_unit_inst/alu_src_b_select_out_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch core_inst/control_unit_inst/imm_extend_op_select_out_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin core_inst/control_unit_inst/imm_extend_op_select_out_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#8 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch core_inst/control_unit_inst/imm_extend_op_select_out_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin core_inst/control_unit_inst/imm_extend_op_select_out_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#9 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch core_inst/control_unit_inst/is_jalr_out_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin core_inst/control_unit_inst/is_jalr_out_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#10 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch core_inst/control_unit_inst/reg_write_enable_out_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin core_inst/control_unit_inst/reg_write_enable_out_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#11 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch core_inst/control_unit_inst/result_source_select_out_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin core_inst/control_unit_inst/result_source_select_out_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 12 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
